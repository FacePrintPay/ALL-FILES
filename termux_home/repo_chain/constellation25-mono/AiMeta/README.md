# AiMeta - AI Metaverse Project

The AI Metaverse Project is an ambitious initiative to create a virtual world powered by artificial intelligence. This immersive environment enables users to interact with each other and with AI-powered entities in a realistic and engaging way. The project aims to revolutionize the way we interact with technology and with each other.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The AI Metaverse project consists of three main components:

### 🔧 AIMetaverseBackend
The backend infrastructure provides APIs for user management, world creation, and AI interaction.
- **Technology**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Port**: 3001
- **Features**: RESTful APIs, user authentication, world management

### 🎨 AIMetaverseFrontend  
The frontend application provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and interacting with the virtual world.
- **Technology**: React.js, Three.js, React Three Fiber
- **Port**: 3000
- **Features**: 3D virtual environments, real-time interactions, responsive design

### 🤖 AIMetaverseAgents
A collection of AI agents that populate the AI Metaverse, capable of engaging in conversation, providing information, and performing tasks.
- **Technology**: Python, FastAPI
- **Port**: 8000
- **Features**: Multiple AI agent types, natural language processing, real-time chat

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.8+
